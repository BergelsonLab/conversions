### Scripts for cha <----> eaf and opf <----> eaf conversions.

#### data/

This directory contains all the data used for testing purposes.

#### awker.sh

A shell script that is mainly a wrapper around an awk script. It extracts annotations from the ELAN csv output to make it look like the output of parse_clan2.py. 

#### cha2eaf.py

Old script from previous work that was used to convert cha files to eaf. Might prove useful.

#### use_pmypi.py

A python script that will convert a cha file to an eaf. It's requirements are in the requirements.txt file. First, install the dependencies with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

#### grep_sed_commands.txt

Short commands that I have found useful are saved here.
